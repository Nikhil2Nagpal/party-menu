🛠️ Tech Stack
React (Functional Components + Hooks)
TypeScript (.tsx) — for type safety & better DX
React Router DOM (for web-based navigation to ingredient screen)
Mock Data (no backend or persistence)
CSS Modules / Inline Styling (clean & minimal)
💡 Note: Assignment mentioned “React Navigation”, which is typically for React Native. Since this is a web app, I’ve used react-router-dom for navigation — which is standard for web projects. If needed, can be replaced with modal-based UI too.
